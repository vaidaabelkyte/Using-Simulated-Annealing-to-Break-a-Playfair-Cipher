<h3><i>Project Overview</h3>
<p>
The field of cryptanalysis is concerned with the study of ciphers, having as its objective the
identification of weaknesses within a cryptographic system that may be exploited to convert
encrypted data (cipher-text) into unencrypted data (plain-text). Whether using symmetric or
asymmetric techniques, cryptanalysis assumes no knowledge of the correct cryptographic key
or even the cryptographic algorithm being used.
Assuming that the cryptographic algorithm is known, a common approach for breaking a cipher
is to generate a large number of keys, decrypt a cipher-text with each key and then examine the
resultant plain-text. If the text looks similar to English, then the chances are that the key is a
good one. The similarity of a given piece of text to English can be computed by breaking the
text into fixed-length substrings, called n-grams, and then comparing each substring to an
existing map of n-grams and their frequency. This process does not guarantee that the outputted
answer will be the correct plain-text, but can give a good approximation that may well be the
right answer.
